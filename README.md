# Flare Framework

## What is Flare?

Flare is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible, and secure. 
More information can be found at the [official site](https://manbaenab.ir/Flare).

This repository holds the distributable version of the framework.

## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!
The user guide updating and deployment is a bit awkward at the moment, but we are working on it!
